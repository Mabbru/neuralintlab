**Proposal (Level 3 Heading)![](Aspose.Words.dcf24916-c718-4878-8fa3-36311f87ee22.001.png)**

I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images. In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow or [PyTorch, and](https://pytorch.org/) other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using mmdetection: ![](Aspose.Words.dcf24916-c718-4878-8fa3-36311f87ee22.002.png)

**Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)**

- python
  - opencv-python
    - tensorflow
      - openmmlab
- package manager

**Installation**

In a bash terminal, run the following commands (*Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer*):

$ sudo apt update ![](Aspose.Words.dcf24916-c718-4878-8fa3-36311f87ee22.004.png)

$ conda create -n cv\_detection $ conda activate cv\_detection $ python --version 

$ python example.py
